If you are reading this, then the doorbell cover is broken (again). >:(  (or you just stumbled across this file by accident)
So basically we had a normal one, but then Antonio like spammed the ever living heck out of the doorbell, loosened the right metal strip and broke the factory-made cover.  
So i designed and made a new one, and had it printed at the fab lab. 
Unfortunatly, it seems to have not stood the test of time.  
  
To replace it, simply download the shell.stl file, put it on a USB and go to the fab lab and ask to have a new one printed. Have someone who does engineering do it, as only engineers have access.
