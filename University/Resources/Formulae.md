# Foreword  
This is a list of all formulae I have come across during my revision for the may exams. It is not a complete list, but will most likely complete the essentails. Enjoy :)  
# Module-Shared  
Power:  
$$P=\frac{E}{t}$$  
# Electronics  
Electric Current:  
$$I=\frac{Q}{t}$$  
Energy of a Charge in an electric field:  
$$E=Vq$$  
Current, Voltage and Resistance:  
$$V=IR$$  
Electric Field Strength:  
$$E=\frac{V}{d}$$  
Force on a charge in a field:  
$$F=qE$$  
Power dissapated through a resistor:  
$$P=IV$$
