# Foreword  
This is a list of all formulae I have come across during my revision for the may exams. It is not a complete list, but will most likely complete the essentails. Enjoy :)  
# Not Module-Spesific  
Power:  
$P=\frac{E}{t}$  
Root Mean Square of a sinusoidal wave:  
$RMS=\frac{\text{Peak Amplitude}}{\sqrt{2}}$  
Root Mean Square for any wave:  
$RMS={\frac{f(t)^2}{T}}^\frac12$  
# Electronics  
## Power  
Power dissapated through a resistor:  
$P=IV$  
$P=I^2R$  
$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$  
## Current  
Electric Current:  
$I=\frac{Q}{t}$  
## Fields  
Energy of a Charge in an electric field:  
$E=Vq$  
Electric Field Strength:  
$E=\frac{V}{d}$  
Force on a charge in a field:  
$F=qE$  
## Resistance  
Current, Voltage and Resistance:  
$V=IR$  
Resistors in series:  
$R_T=R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n$  
Resistors in parallel:  
$R_T=\left(R_1^{-1}+R_2^{-1}+\cdots+R_n^{-1}\right)^{-1}$
